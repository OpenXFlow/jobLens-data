    "description": "Overview\nThis role offers the opportunity to own and shape a modern ASP.NET platform that underpins millions of applications worldwide, spanning high traffic consumer products and mission critical enterprise systems. You will tackle challenges at the scale and complexity of globally used applications, diving deep into the fundamentals of .NET such as runtime behavior, performance, concurrency, and clean architecture. This is hands on, high impact engineering where code quality, thoughtful system design, and long term technical decisions genuinely matter, and where the platform you build becomes a foundation other engineers rely on every day.\nYou will collaborate with a team of top engineers who care deeply about craftsmanship and thoughtful problem solving. Together, you will evolve a platform that blends proven ASP.NET foundations with modern capabilities, including AI driven features that improve automation, insight, and decision making across the system. You will have the opportunity to influence architecture, introduce intelligent solutions, and build technology designed to last, used at scale, trusted in production, and built by engineers who take pride in strong fundamentals.\nResponsibilities\nDesign, build, and evolve core ASP.NET platform components with a focus on scalability, reliability, and long term maintainability.\nTake ownership of architectural decisions across services, APIs, and shared libraries, ensuring strong alignment with .NET best practices and clean design principles.\nCollaborate closely with other engineers to review designs and code, raise engineering standards, and contribute to a culture of technical excellence.\nIntegrate intelligent and data driven capabilities into the platform, working with AI powered services and tooling to enhance automation, insight, and system behavior.\nCollaborate with engineers across product teams and the open-source community to co-design and iterate on developer experiences.\nQualifications\nBS in Computer Science, EE, Computer Engineering or equivalent experience.\nStrong professional experience in building and operating production systems using ASP.NET, and ASP.NET Core.\nStrong experience in C# and .NET, including system-level or library/framework development.\nDeep understanding of cross-platform development principles.\nExperience contributing to libraries, SDKs, or frameworks rather than just applications.\nThis position will be open for a minimum of 5 days, with applications accepted on an ongoing basis until the position is filled.\nMicrosoft is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, citizenship, color, family or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information, immigration status, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, protected veteran or military status, race, ethnicity, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable local laws, regulations and ordinances.
