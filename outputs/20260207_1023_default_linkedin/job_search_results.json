Having an opinion and voicing your ideas is not only welcome but encouraged, especially when they challenge the status quo. </li><li>Learn from experienced mentors and achieve tremendous personal and professional growth. Get to know and leverage our network of leading tech investors and advisors around the globe. </li><li>Receive a top-of-market equity and cash compensation package. </li><li>Get access to a self-development budget you can use to e.g. attend conferences, buy books or take classes. </li><li>Receive a new Apple MacBook Pro, as well as meaningful home office set-up. <br><br></li></ul>Our Stance<br><br><ul><li>We're eager to meet talented and driven candidates regardless of whether they tick all the boxes. We're looking for someone who will add to our culture, not just fit within it. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underestimated and underrepresented in tech to apply. </li><li>We seek to actively recognize and combat racism, sexism, ableism and ageism. We embrace and support all gender identities and expressions, and celebrate love in its many forms.
