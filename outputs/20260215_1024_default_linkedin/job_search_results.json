    "description": "Meetup is a community-building platform that millions of people use to discover events, meet others who share their interests, and cultivate meaningful real-world connections. Now part of Bending Spoons, it plays a key role in a portfolio of outstanding digital businesses united by a shared focus on innovation and operational excellence. By applying through the Meetup brand, you’ll be stepping into the wider Bending Spoons team. You may work directly on Meetup or contribute to one of our other leading products. Either way, you’ll be part of a high-performing, collaborative environment where you can make a real impact.\nAt Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\nTo achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\nFor a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\nA few examples of your responsibilities\nMaster your toolkit.\nBy working across diverse tech stacks in a full-stack, end-to-end scope, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.\nBuild stuff that matters.\nRegardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.\nSimplify relentlessly.\nIs every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.\nWhat we look for\nReasoning ability.\nGiven the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\nDrive.\nYou’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.\nTeam spirit.\nYou give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\nProficiency in English.\nYou read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\nWhat we offer\nIncredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.\nYou’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\nAn exceptional opportunity for growth.\nWe go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\nCompetitive pay and access to equity in the company.\nTypically, we offer individuals at the start of their career an annual salary of £85,797 in London and €66,065 elsewhere in Europe. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £112,189 and £250,512 in London, and €107,837 and €188,848 elsewhere in Europe. Compensation varies by location and expected impact, and grows rapidly as you gain experience and translate it into greater contributions. For individuals who demonstrate exceptional capability, we may offer compensation that extends beyond the usual ranges to reflect their higher expected impact. If you're offered a permanent contract, you'll also be able receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\nAll. These. Benefits.\nFlexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\nCommitment & contract\nPermanent or fixed-term. Full-time.\nLocation\nMilan (Italy), London (UK), Madrid (Spain), Warsaw (Poland) or remote in selected countries.\nThe selection process\nIn our screening process, we prioritize verifiable signals of excellence, regardless of seniority. Some people hold back because they feel they lack experience or have an “imperfect” CV. If you like the role and believe you could excel over time, don’t self-reject.\nIf you pass our screening, you’ll be asked to complete one or more tests. They are challenging, may involve unfamiliar problems, and can take several hours.\nWe set the bar high and won’t extend an offer until we’re confident we’ve found the right candidate. This is why a job may remain open for months or be reposted several times.\nWe consider all applicants for employment and provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities—please let us know through this form.\nBefore you apply\nIf you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.\nBending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.\nTo help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location.

More than 1,700 sports federations, media outlets, betting operators, and consumer platforms across 120 countries rely on our know-how and technology to boost their business.<br><br><br><br></p><strong>Job Description<br><br></strong><p><strong>About us <br><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ad:s </strong>is a data-driven marketing and sponsorship solution designed to help deliver significant efficiency improvements against marketing investments. The ad:s team develop and provide fully-customisable purpose-built, proprietary tools and services to meet the individual marketing needs of sportsbooks and publishers. Through our broad sales network, relationships and vast infrastructure that extends across the globe, the team also facilitates sponsorship opportunities for bookmakers. <br><br></p><p>We’re looking for a QA Engineer in <strong>Vienna</strong> who’s ready to move beyond running test cases, who wants to help shape what we build and why, not just how well it works.<br><br>If you enjoy exploring systems, questioning assumptions, and uncovering gaps early, you might be the person we’re looking for.<br><br></p><p><strong>The Challenge<br></strong><br><br><br>You’ll be part of a cross-functional team where feedback flows freely between product owners, designers, engineers, and testers alike. Your main job won’t be to “break things,” but to help us understand what’s worth building how to build it right and how to validate the outcome. You’ll collaborate closely with developers and product managers to:<br><br></p><ul><li>Help define requirements and ensure they’re testable and meaningful</li><li>Identify risks before they become bugs</li><li>Verify that what we deliver truly solves the problem we set out to solve</li><li>Provide constructive, timely feedback during design and development phases</li><li>Provide feedback that improves product quality and team understanding</li><li>Help shape testing approach of the team, from exploratory sessions to automated checks</li><li>Investigate, report, and discuss defects with empathy and precision</li><li>Support developers in verifying data integrity and feature consistency</li><li>Contribute to continuous improvement in team processes and testing methodology</li><li>You’ll still write and run tests, of course, but your most valuable work will happen before code is even written, not after deployment</li></ul><p><strong>About You<br></strong><br><br><br>We expect you to already have enough experience working in software testing or quality assurance to know that testing isn’t just about finding bugs. You should be comfortable communicating across roles and curious about how systems and users connect.<br><br><br><br>We’d like to hear from you if you:<br><br></p><ul><li>are comfortable discussing requirements,</li><li>think critically about design and usability,</li><li>can express feedback clearly and constructively,</li><li>want to grow as both a tester and a collaborator,</li><li>can balance attention to detail with understanding the bigger picture,</li><li>enjoy learning new tools and techniques as needed.</li></ul><p>Experience with API or integration testing, and a basic ability to read or write code (in any language) would be useful, but we care more about how you think than the tools you already know.<br><br></p><p><strong>Our Offer<br><br></strong></p><ul><li>A collaborative, curious, and supportive environment where feedback is valued.</li><li>Freedom to experiment and shape how testing is done in your team.</li><li>Flexible working hours and hybrid work setup.</li><li>Learning opportunities and professional development support.</li><li>Regular team events, great coffee, and a genuinely kind group of colleagues.</li></ul><p><strong>Our Recruitment Process  <br><br></strong></p><ol><li><p>Initial Screening: A quick chat with our Talent Acquisition Partner to understand your background and expectations. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Technical Interview: Initial conversation focusing on general fit, motivation, and basic subject-matter knowledge. <br><br></p></li><li><p>In-person Testing Challenge<strong>:</strong> Second-stage interview focused on a hands-on exercise that blends open-ended exploration with technical depth. You will be asked to share your screen and work through the task alongside team members from the relevant area.<br><br></p></li><li><p>Final Steps: Receive feedback and, if successful, an offer! <br><br></p></li></ol><p>We encourage everyone to apply, even if you don’t meet every listed requirement.
